`tcpdump` is the premier network analysis tool for [information security](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security)
professionals. Having a solid grasp of this uber-powerful application is
mandatory for anyone desiring a thorough understanding of [TCP/IP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCPIP).
Many prefer to use higher level analysis tools such as [~~Ethereal~~ Wireshark](http://www.ethereal.com/),
but I believe this to usually be a mistake.

In a discipline so dependent on a true understanding of concepts vs. [rote
learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rote_learning), it's important to stay
fluent in the underlying mechanics of the TCP/IP suite. A thorough grasp of
these protocols allows one to troubleshoot at a level far beyond the average
analyst, but mastery of the protocols is only possible through continued
exposure to them.

When using a tool that displays network traffic a more natural (raw) way the
burden of analysis is placed directly on the human rather than the application.
This approach cultivates continued and elevated understanding of the TCP/IP
suite, and for this reason I strongly advocate using `tcpdump` instead of other
tools whenever possible.

# Options

Below are a few options (with examples) that will help you greatly when working
with the tool. They're easy to forget and/or confuse with other types of
filters, i.e. ethereal, so hopefully this page can serve as a reference for
you, as it does me.

First of all, I like to add a few options to the `tcpdump` command itself,
depending on what I'm looking at. The first of these is -n, which requests that
names are not resolved, resulting in the IPs themselves always being displayed.
The second is -X, which displays both hex and ascii content within the packet.
The final one is -S, which changes the display of sequence numbers to absolute
rather than relative. The idea there is that you can't see weirdness in the
sequence numbers if they're being hidden from you. Remember, the advantage of
using `tcpdump` vs. another tool is getting manual interaction with the
packets.

It's also important to note that `tcpdump` only takes the first ~~68~~ 96 bytes
of data from a packet by default. If you would like to look at more, add the -s
number option to the mix, where number is the number of bytes you wnat to
capture. I recommend using 0 (zero) for a snaplength, which gets everything.
Here's a short list of the options I use most:

[NOTE: All of the following come after `tcpdump`, for example:`tcpdump -i any`]

* `-i any`: Listen on all interfaces just to see if you're seeing any traffic.

* `-i eth0`: Listen on the eth0 interface.

* `-D`: Show the list of available interfaces.

* `-n`: Don't resolve hostnames.

* `-nn`: Don't resolve hostnames or port names.

* `-q`: Be less verbose (more quiet) with your output.

* `-X`: Show the packet's _contents_ in both [hex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexidecimal) and [ASCII](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascii).

* `-XX`: Same as `-X`, but also shows the ethernet header.

* `-v, -vv, -vvv`: Increase the amount of packet information you get back.

* `-c`: Only get x number of packets and then stop.

* `icmp`: Only get ICMP packets.

* `-s`: Define the _snaplength_ (size) of the capture in bytes. Use `-s0` to
  get everything, unless you are intentionally capturing less.

* `-S`: Print absolute sequence numbers.

* `-e`: Get the ethernet header as well.

* `-q`: Show less protocol information.

* `-E`: Decrypt IPSEC traffic by providing an encryption key.

_[The default snaplength as of `tcpdump` 4.0 has changed from 68 bytes to
96 bytes. While this will give you more of a packet to see, it still won't get
everything. Use `-s 1514` to get full coverage ]_

# Basic Usage

So, based on the kind of traffic I'm looking for, I use a different combination
of options to `tcpdump`, as can be seen below:

1. Basic communication // see the basics without many options

        # tcpdump -nS

2. Basic communication (very verbose) // see a good amount of traffic, with
   verbosity and no name help

        # tcpdump -nnvvS

3. A deeper look at the traffic // adds -X for peyload but doesn't grab any
   more of the packet

        # tcpdump -nnvvXS

4. Heavy packet viewing // the final "s" increases the snaplength, grabbing the
   whole packet

        # tcpdump -nnvvXSs 1514

Here's a capture of exactly two (-c2) [ICMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icmp)
packets ( a [ping](http://www.networksorcery.com/enp/protocol/icmp/msg8.htm)
and [pong](http://www.networksorcery.com/enp/protocol/icmp/msg0.htm)) using
some of the options described above. Notice how much we see about each packet.

# Examples

Expressions allow you to trim out various types of traffic and find exactly
what you're looking for. Mastering the expressions and learning to combine them
creatively is what makes on truly powerful with `tcpdump`. There are three main
types of expression: `type`, `dir`, and `proto`.

Type options are `host`, `net`, and `port`. Direction is indicated by `dir`,
and there you can have `src`, `dst`, `src or dst`, and `src and dst`. Here are
a few that you should definitely be comfortable with:

* `host` // look for traffic based on IP address (also works with hostname if
  you're not using -n)

        # tcpdump host 1.2.3.4

* `src`, `dst` // find traffic from only a source or destination (eliminates
  one side of a host conversation)

        # tcpdump src 2.3.4.5
        # tcpdump dst 3.4.5.6

* `net` // capture an entire network using [CIDR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) notation

        # tcpdump net 1.2.3.0/24

* `proto` // works for tcp, udp, and icmp. Note that you don't have to type
  `proto`

        # tcpdump icmp

* `port` // see only traffic to or from a certain port

        # tcpdump port 3389

* `src, dst port` // filter based on the source or destination port

        # tcpdump src port 1025 # tcpdump dst port 389

* `src/dst, port, protocal` // combine all three

        # tcpdump src port 1025 and tcp
        # tcpdump udp and src port 53

You also have the option to filter by a range of ports instead of declaring
them individually, and to only see packets that are above or below a certain
size.

* **Port Ranges** // see traffic to any port in a range

        tcpdump portrange 21-23

* **Packet Size Filter** // only see packets below or above a certain size (in
  bytes)

        tcpdump less 32
        tcpdump greater 128

    _[You can use the symbols for less than, greater than, and less than or eauql/greater
than or equal signs as well. ]_

    // filtering for size using symbols

        tcpdump > 32
        dcpdump <= 128

# Writing to a File

`tcpdump` allows you to send what you're capturing to a file for later use
using the `-w` option, and then to read it back using the `-r` option. This is
an excelet way to capture raw traffic and then run it through various tools
later.

The traffic captured in this way is stored in `tcpdump` format, which is pretty
much universal in the network analysis space. This means it can be read in by
all sorts of tools, including Wireshark, Snort, etc.

## Capture all Port 80 Traffic to a File

    # tcpdump -s 1514 port 80 -w capture_file

Then, at some point in the future, you can then read the traffic back in like
so:

## Read Captured Traffic back into `tcpdump`

    # tcpdump -r capture_file

# Getting Creative

Expressions are nice, but the real magic of `tcpdump` comes from the ability to
combine them in creative ways in order to isolate exactly what you're lokking
for. There are three ways to do combinations, and if you've studied computers
at all they'll be pretty familar to you:

1. And

    `and` or `&&`

2. OR

    `or` or `||`o

3. EXCEPT

    `not` or `!`

## More Examples

_# TCP traffic from 10.5.2.3 destined for port 3398_

    tcpdump -nnvvS src 10.5.2.3 and dst port 3389

_# Traffic originating from the 192.168 network headed for the 10 or 172.16
networks

    tcpdump -nvX src net 192.168.0.0/16 and dst net 10.0.0.0/8 or 172.16.0.0/16

_# Non-ICP traffic destined for 192.168.0.2 from the 172.16 network

    tcpdump -nvvXSs 1514 dst 192.168.0.2 and src net and not icmp

_# Traffic originating from Mars or Pluto that isn't to the SSH port

    tcpdump -vv src mars and not dst port 22

As you can see, you can build queries to find just about anything you need. The
key is to first figure out precisely what you're looking for and then to build
the syntax to isolate that specific type of traffic.

## Grouping

Also keep in mind that when you're building complex queries you might have to
group your options using single quotes. Single quotes are used in order to tell
`tcpdump` to ignore certain special characters -- in this case the "()"
brackets. This same technique can be used to group using other expressions such
as `host`, `port`, `net`, etc. Take a look at the command below:

_# Traffic that's from 10.0.2.4 AND destined for ports 3389 or 22 (incorrect)_

    tcpdump src 10.0.2.4 and (dst port 3389 or 22)

If you tried to run this otherwise very useful command, you'd get an error
because of the parenthesis. You can either fix this by escaping the parenthesis
(putting a \ before each one), or by putting the entire command within single
quotes:

_# Traffic that's from 10.0.2.4 AND destined for ports 3389 or 22 (correct)

    tcpdump 'src 10.0.2.4 and (dst port 3389 or 22)'

# Advanced

You can also filter based on specific portions of a packet, as well as combine
multiple conditions into groups. The former is useful when looking for only
SYNs or RSTs, for example, and the latter for even more advanced traffic
isolation.

_[ Hint: AN anagram for the TCP flags: [Unskilled Attackers Pester Real
Security Folk ](https://danielmiessler.com/study/tcpflags/) ]_

Show me all URGENT (URG) packets...

    # tcpdump 'tcp[13] & 32!=0'

Show me all ACKNOWLEDGE (ACK) packets...

    # tcpdump 'tcp[13] & 16!=0'

Show me all PUSH (PSH) packets...

    # tcpdump 'tcp[13] & 8!=0'

Show me all RESET (RST)  packets...

    # tcpdump 'tcp[13] & 4!=0'

Show me all SYNCHRONIZE (SYN) packets...

    # tcpdump 'tcp[13] & 2!=0'

Show me all FINISH (FIN) packets...

    # tcpdump 'tcp[13] & 1!=0'

Show me all SYNCHRONIZE/ACKNOWLEDGE (SYNACK) packets...

    # tcpdump 'tcp[13]=18'

_[ Note: Only the PSH, RST, SYN, and FIN flags are displayed in `tcpdump`'s
flag field output. URGs and ACKs are displayed, but they are shown elsewhere in
the output rather than in the flags field ]_

Keep in mind the reasons these filters work. The filters above find these
various packets because `tcp[13]` looks at offset 13 in the [TCP header](http://www.networksorcery.com/enp/protocol/tcp.htm),
the number represents the locatio within the byte, and the !=0 means that the
flag in question is set to 1, i.e. it's on.

As with most powerful tools, however, there are multiple ways to do things. The
example below shows another way to capture packets with specific TCP flags set.

Capture TCP Flags Using the `tcpflags` Option...

    # tcpdump 'tcp[tcpflags] & & tcp-syn != 0'

## Specialized Traffic

Finally, there are a few quick recipes you'll want to remember for catching
specific and specialized traffic, such as IPv6 and malformed/likely-malicious
packets.

IPv6 traffic

    # tcpdump ip6

Packets with both the RST and SYN flags set (why?)

    # tcpdump 'tcp[13] = 6'

Traffic with the 'Evil Bit' Set

    # tcpdump 'ip[6] & 128 != 0'

# Conclusion

Well, this primer should get you going strong, but [the main page](http://www.tcpdump.org/tcpdump_man.html)
should always be handy for the most advanced and one-off usage scenarioos. I
truly hope this has been useful to you, and feel free to [contact me](https://danielmiessler.com/contact/)
